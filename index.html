       Purpose of the protest  
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Nigerian police in conjunction with the sars gained high interest in the extortion and deprivation of the human rights of the youths. The youths had to take action.
        These were youths who are addressed as the leaders of tomorrow. Are they supposed to go through this?
        To fight for themselves, a protest is ensued and government called to take action.

        Government's action
      </h2>
      <p>
        Inasmuch as the youths are concerned, the government has failed them in all threshold. The government rolled out military personnels and soldiers to tame the youths instead of resolving the issue by calling the Sars and police to order.

      Never to happen again
    </h2>
    <p>
      The EndSars protest was a disastrous one, although that wasn't how it started out as.
      We hope for a better Nigeria, someday. We are great people and hazardous incidents like this shouldn't happen to us ever again.
